# Identifying Credit Risk

We are tasked with identifying credit risk for a peer to peer lending company. Using machine learning, we will work with imbalanced data to use linear regression machine learning style to correctly predict loans as healthy or high-risk. We will compare the precision and recall with imbalanced and balanced methods.

## *Technologies*

- **Programming Language:** Python and SQL
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Pathlib, Sklearn, Imblearn
- **Framework:** JupyterLab, can also use VS Code
- **Operating Systems:** Microsoft Windows

## *Installation Guide*

****
- **1:** Install Jupyter Labs and run it from the terminal. Make sure that you make sure you have an up-to-date version of Python
 [Install and run JupyterLab:](https://jupyter.org/install)
- **2:** Copy URL of this repo
- **3:** Clone folder to this repo and open in jupyter labs
- **4:** Ensure that you have the imports correctly identified to download

## *Usage*

**Jupyter Lab**
- Running the code can be done in one of two ways:
    1. You can click the "play" button at the very top of the notebook.
    2. You can click shift + enter on each block of code to run each batch of code as you go through it.

## *Final Product*
We used machine learning linear regression to acurately predict the high-risk loans. The imbalanced data had a recall of 91% so we rebalanced the data and achieved a recall of 99%. You can see the models below.
